    "# Unsupervised Learning Example - Semantic Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The first machine learning model we will examine in more detail belongs to the class of unsupervised models.\n",
    "Semantic spaces (also called word embeddings) are a form of machine learning models that tries to attempt to learn the relationships between words. \n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean? While for a human it is simple to identify that speaking and spoken are very closely related and cat and dog share a relationship, this is not evident for a computer. How can we represent concepts in a form that allows computers to operate based on their meaning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Early attempts to do so (for example as part of search engines) were based on linguistic analysis of words. Identifying the common base form of verbs and plural and singular nouns allowed computer programs to \"understand\" that \"rocket\" and \"rockets\" are very closely related concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern approaches to represent the meaning of concepts are based on calculating a numeric representation (a vector with values) for concepts. Based on this approach it is possible to then to calculate how similar two concepts are by using a metric (e.g. a distance metric such as the euclidean distance or the cosine).\n",
    "Probably the most famous of these semantic word spaces is called Word2Vec ( [original Word2Vec implementation by Google](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) ).\n",
    "The idea behind Word2Vec  is pretty simple. We are making and assumption that \"you can tell the meaning of a word by the company it keeps\" (Firth 1957 Linguist). This is analogous to the saying *show me your friends, and I'll tell who you are*. So if you have two words that have very similar neighbors (i.e. the usage context is about the same), then these words are probably quite similar in meaning or are at least highly related. For example, the words `shocked`,`appalled` and `astonished` are typically used in a similar context. "

If your neighbor's position is greater than the maximum window width to the left and the right, then, some neighbors are not considered as being related to the target word. In theory, a smaller window should give allow you to strengthen relationships that are synonymous, while larger window sizes favor associative relationships.\n",

Based on word priming experimentation, two main relations between words have been identified (see [CHIA1990]): synonymous relations (also referred to as similar or semantic relations in the cognitive science literature) and associative relations. As outlined in [CHIA1990], the distinction for both relationship types is not exclusive; that is, word relations are not exclusively synonymous or associative. Doctor - Nurse is an example of a word relation that can be considered as being of a synonymous-associative nature.\n",

    "Machine learning is a game of complexity.\n",
    "Even in the most simplistic setups you will usually deal with quite a range of factors (algorithm implementations, large amount of used packages, pre-processing pipelines, training material).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "At the least your setup should document and version:\n",

    "* Training Material Used (i.e. what collection, e.g. timestamped, S3 bucket)\n",
    "* Codebase Used (git tag or commit hash)\n",
    "* Hyperparameters used\n",
